# AOOL
Another object oriented Language (AOOL)
AOOL is simple object oriented language for compiler course.
AOOL programs are sets of classes. A class encapsulates the variables and procedures of a data type.
Instances of a class are objects. In AOOL, classes and types are identified; i.e., every class defines a type.
Classes permit programmers to define new types and associated procedures (or methods) specific to those
types. Inheritance allows new types to extend the behavior of existing types.
